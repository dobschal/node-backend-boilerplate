# Node Backend Boilerplate

This repository contains boilerplate code to cook your own backend app with NodeJS, TypeScript, Postgres SQL and Docker.


## ðŸš€ Get Started

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

Then use Docker Compose to run the server.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will run the server on the configured port and enable auto-restart on code changes ðŸ˜Ž! 

## ðŸ”¨ Build & Run
Build the docker image with name `node-boilerplate` and tag `latest`:
```bash
docker build . -t node-server:latest
```

Run a Docker container with the previous built image and expose port 3000:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 node-server:latest
```
